506,Article on charging Tesla during trip from St Petersburg to Tallahassee,OriginalEchoTheCat,"
The below specifically discusses Perry florida. It is where I live, and I can add my 'yes, unfortunately this is the attitude of most people in Perry florida.""

Four ‚ÄúTesla vehicle charging only‚Äù signs had been stolen from their poles. And in their place, as well as on the signs that hadn‚Äôt been vandalized, there were Trump stickers (below and in the main photo):

ÔøºÔøºThe red Tesla charging sign is gone, and in its place is a Trump sticker.

It would be safe to assume that someone in Perry wanted to send a message to Tesla drivers that they perceive the Supercharger to be a political threat, which is not only ridiculous, but also incredibly sad. Driving EVs isn‚Äôt political, yet it‚Äôs been politicized.

I found myself feeling trepidation as we approached Perry on our return visit, as the last thing I wanted to do was to ask someone to move their gas pickup truck so I could charge. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt have to, but it‚Äôs wrong that I felt that way.

The next day I called¬†Roady‚Äôs Truck Stops, which manages the Perry site. Roady‚Äôs is the largest group of independently owned truck stops in the US, and it‚Äôs based in Idaho. Their customer service rep was extremely sympathetic and proactive, and said they‚Äôd speak to the manager of the Perry Supercharger about getting those issues rectified quickly.

Perhaps the manager might consider doing a little public relations work with the residents of Perry on the benefits of having a Supercharger destination in their town, where he or she can also explain to people why it‚Äôs not cool to park in a charging bay‚Äî their hostility is not only misdirected, but also unfounded due to ignorance

Tesla, Inc.  is an American [electric vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle) and [clean energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_energy) company based in [Palo Alto, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), with plans to move its headquarters to [Austin, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas) in the future. Tesla designs and manufactures [electric cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car), battery [energy storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage) from home to [grid-scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid-scale_storage), [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel) and [solar roof tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_roof_shingles), and related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of [battery electric vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle) and [plug-in electric vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle), capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes [plug-in hybrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid)) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market.

It looks and drives completely fine so I'm inclined to do nothing but it just seems strange to do nothing. Thanks!",Tesla,1620598139

## FAQ

1. **When next/orbital flight?** Unknown. Launches on hold until FAA environmental review completed. Elon says orbital test [hopefully May](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1505987581464367104?cxt=HHwWgMCq1b3uq-YpAAAA). Others believe completing GSE, booster, and ship testing makes a late 2022 orbital launch possible but unlikely.
1. **Expected date for FAA decision?** [April 29 per FAA statement](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1507451621273440281), but it has been delayed many times.
1. **Will Booster 4 / Ship 20 fly?** No. Elon [confirmed](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1505987581464367104?cxt=HHwWgMCq1b3uq-YpAAAA) first orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 (B7/S24).
1. **Will more suborbital testing take place?** Unknown. It may depend on the FAA decision.
1. **Has progress slowed down?** SpaceX focused on completing ground support equipment (GSE, or ""Stage 0"") before any orbital launch, which Elon stated is as complex as building the rocket.

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/ttdbfe/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion_april/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/t3tur1/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion_march/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/shgfej/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed. 
We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70¬∞ shell and East coast launches for the 53.2¬∞ shell, based on FCC filings.

The next Starlink launch is [Starlink Group 4-5 from KSC LC-39A on 2022-01-18 at 00:26:00 UTC](https://twitter.com/TSKelso/status/1482165633802334208).

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

### About The Recovery

Ground controllers at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, will send commands at 10:40 a.m. for Dragon to undock from the space-facing port of the station‚Äôs Harmony module and fire its thrusters to move a safe distance away from the station. Controllers will command a deorbit burn the following day.

After re-entering Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, the spacecraft will make a parachute-assisted splashdown about 12:44 a.m. Monday, Jan. 24, off the coast of Florida. NASA TV will not broadcast the splashdown but the agency will provide updates on the space station blog.

### Returning Science

*  Last light: A state-of-the-art light imaging microscope, the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will return after about 12 years on the station. LMM, sponsored by NASA‚Äôs Division of Biological and Physical Sciences, made it possible to observe and record the way matter is organized and moves on the microscopic level, and supported ground-breaking colloid research, plant studies, and thermophysics experiments.

* Tiny structures, assemble: The InSPACE-4 physics study is returning samples that could provide insight into how to harness nanoparticles to fabricate and manufacture new materials, including medical diagnostics and thermal shields for Earth and space applications.

* Cell signaling in microgravity: The ESA (European Space Agency) investigation Cytoskeleton contributes to understanding of how the human body responds to microgravity. The study could support development of countermeasures to help astronaut crew members maintain optimum health on future space missions.

We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/r616aw/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed. 
We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70¬∞ shell and East coast launches for the 53.2¬∞ shell, based on FCC filings.

The next Starlink launch is [Starlink 4-3](https://twitter.com/EmreKelly/status/1462977907626754050)

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed.  Approximately 24 hours before liftoff of a Starlink,  a launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/qk1xi9/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/pyw3bj/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed.  We are currently in a hiatus between launches.

We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70¬∞ shell and East coast launches for the 53.2¬∞ shell, based on FCC filings.

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed.  Approximately 24 hours before liftoff of a Starlink,  a launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

3900,Upcoming Zubrin AMA - Saturday September 25th,yoweigh,"We are very pleased to announce that Dr. Robert Zubrin will be returning for another r/SpaceX AMA on Saturday September 25th, in conjunction with The Mars Society. While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, Dr. Zubrin is the Mars Society President and one of its original 1998 founders. One of Earth's most famous and passionate advocates for Mars, Dr. Zubrin backs that energy with serious engineering knowledge. He has contributed to hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous Mars Direct mission which was a major influence on Elon‚Äôs own Martian ambitions! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject, many of which are available on Youtube. Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades. Since SpaceX was founded with the primary goal of getting humanity to Mars, clearly there is a deep shared purpose here. Dr. Zubrin has been watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us!

The Mars Society also has their upcoming 23rd annual international convention on Oct 15-18, which is online this year and free to join.  
https://www.marssociety.org/conventions/2021/

We‚Äôre looking forward to another spectacular AMA, and we trust that this community will have some really solid questions for Dr. Z!

Special thanks to Edward Heisler and Lucinda Offer of The Mars Society (https://www.marssociety.org/) for helping put together this AMA. You can get involved without ever leaving reddit on r/MarsSociety, where you can really get involved in getting our asses to Mars!",spacex,1632277280
